Hi, I'm Jordan. Iâ€™m currently an undergrad at Simon Fraser University, majoring in Computing Science. My interests are in backend development, systems architecture and infrastructure.

I've interned at [Safe Software](https://safe.com), [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com), and most recently at[Demonware](https://demonware.net).

I am graduating in Dec 2019 and will be looking for full-time opportunities. If you think I'm a [good fit](resume.pdf), you can reach me [here](mailto:jordansiaw.cy@gmail.com)!

Check out other things I do on the interwebs here:

- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jordansiaw/): :camera: What I see through the viewfinder.
- [Monologue Mode](https://www.instagram.com/monologuemode/): :book: Notes and stories on photos I've taken.
- [Github](https://github.com/onethirdzero): :computer: Source code for projects.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onethirdzero): :thought_balloon: Mostly lurking, with the occasional tweet about new stuff I've learned.
