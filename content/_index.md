Hi, I'm Jordan. Iâ€™m currently an undergrad at Simon Fraser University, majoring in Computing Science. My main interests are in backend development, systems architecture and infrastructure.

I've previously interned at [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com) and [Safe Software](https://safe.com). I'm currently looking for an internship for Winter 2019, so please reach out if you think I'm a [good fit](resume.pdf)!

You can reach me at [jordansiaw.cy@gmail.com](mailto:jordansiaw.cy@gmail.com).

Check out other things I do on the interwebs here:

- [Monologue Mode](https://www.instagram.com/monologuemode/): Notes and stories on photos I've taken.
- [Github](https://github.com/onethirdzero): Source code for projects.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onethirdzero): Mostly lurking, with the occasional tweet about new blog posts.
