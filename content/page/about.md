Hi, I'm Jordan. I'm a Computing Science student based in Vancouver, Canada.

I started this blog partly because I was intrigued by the concept of managing my own static content, and partly because I'm playing with the idea of making some of my writing public.

You can see what else I do on the interwebs on [Github](https://github.com/onethirdzero) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onethirdzero).

This site relies on:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/) by [Munif Tanjim](https://twitter.com/MunifTanjim)
