Hi, I'm Jordan. I'm a Computing Science student based in Vancouver, Canada.

I started this blog partly because I was intrigued by the concept of managing my own static content, and partly because I'm playing with the idea of making some of my writing public.

#### On technical topics

More often than not, I'll come across a topic that I'm interested in with source material that is too technical for me to dive into. I'll try to brute force it for a bit, but I'll usually end up putting it aside for another day.

Sometime down the road, I'll chance upon a one-liner tweet or [a blog post with just the right level of abstraction](http://blog.mbrt.it/2017-10-01-demystifying-container-networking/), and boom, I'll have a strong enough mental model of that concept to take on the original literature.

I'm relatively new to tech, so I hope that by documenting my journey, I'll be able to help others find that same 'aha!' moment and set them on their way.

#### On non-technical topics

I'm an introspective person, so it can sometimes get a little crowded in my head. Writing things down helps me refocus and refine what I'm pondering. As a good friend once said, it helps "close the chapter".


I'm also [inspired](https://www.susanjfowler.com/) to [write](https://zachholman.com/) by a bunch of [people](https://twitter.com/bitario) in tech.
